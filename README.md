=============

After trying many blog sites, I finally settled in Github Pages, no database nor rich text editor. 
Just as simple as it can when writing the markdown posts. This site is about my thoughts and writings
in programming(mainly in python and golang), mathematics and something about my life.

### 使用

```bash
$ npm install -g hexo
$ git clone https://github.com/qiwihui/qiwihui.github.io.git
$ cd blog
$ git submodule update --init
$ npm install
$ hexo generate --deploy --debug
```
