    <h1>5 centimaters per second</h1>
    <p>I listened to the song <em>One more time, One more chance</em> inadvertently, and it feels good. 
	It reminds me of the movie shared with the same name，a story about distance.</p>
    <p>If I travel in 5 centimeters per second for ten year,</p>
    <p>In math, I will get <code>5cm x (10 x 365 + 2~3) x 24 x 24 x 60</code>.</p>
    <p>But in life, I will see much scenery during the journey.</p>
    <p>Does cherry really falls at speed of 5 centimeters per second?</p>

    <p>English Lyric:</p>
    <p>
    Tell me how much more do I have to lose<br>
    Before I can ever forgive myself<br>
    Do you know how much more pain I must endure<br>
    Before I can ever see your face again<br>
    One more time - Tell me why the seasons keep on changing<br>
    One more time - Missing all the times that we shared as one<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    All those times when we used to argue back and forth<br>
    I always just let you have it your way<br>
    What kind of spell did you cast on me<br>
    I even loved all of your selfish ways<br>
    One more chance - When I find myself lost in those memories<br>
    One more chance - I don't know where to go or where to land<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It doesn't matter where I am because<br>
    I can't help but look for you everywhere<br>
    On the station platform, in the alley windows<br>
    I keep fooling myself thinking I might find you there<br>
    Never thought I would wish upon a star<br>
    I just want to be there by your side<br>
    There's nothing that I won't do, I'd give up everything<br>
    Just to hold you in my arms, one more time<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    If all I wanted was just not to be alone,<br>
    I should be happy with just anyone<br>
    But tonight the stars are hanging by a thread,<br>
    and I can't lie to myself anymore<br>
    One more time - Tell me why the seasons keep on changing<br>
    One more time - Missing all the times that we shared as one<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It doesn't matter where I am because<br>
    Can't help but look for you everywhere<br>
    At the intersection, even in my dreams<br>
    Knowing there is no way you would be there<br>
    If I could just believe in miracles<br>
    I would do anything to show you now<br>
    In the morning light, completely new me<br>
    I'd tell you what I couldn't say before,“I love you.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Memories of our summers together ooh<br>
    Our beating hearts were heard no more<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It doesn't matter where I am because<br>
    Can't help but look for you everywhere<br>
    The morning sun rises, city of Sakuragi<br>
    I keep fooling myself thinking I might find you there<br>
    Never thought I would wish upon a star<br>
    I just need you right here by my side<br>
    There's nothing that I won't do, I'd give up everything<br>
    Just to hold you in my arms, one more time<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It doesn't matter where I am because<br>
    Can't help but look for a trace of you<br>
    At every corner store, in the newspaper<br>
    Knowing there is no way that you would be there<br>
    If I could just believe in miracles, I would open my heart up once again<br>
    In the morning light, a completely new me<br>
    I'd tell you what I couldn't say before,“I love you.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It doesn't matter where I am because<br>
    Can't help but to search for your smile<br>
    At the railway crossing, watching the trains pass by<br>
    Even though there's no way that you'd be there<br>
    If I could live my life all over again, I would be with you for all time<br>
    There's nothing else in this world I want more than what I had<br>
    There would never be anything but you that I would ask for<br>
    </p>
