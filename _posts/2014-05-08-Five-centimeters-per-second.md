I listened to the song *One more time, One more chance* inadvertently, and it feels good. 
It reminds me of the movie shared with the same name，a story about distance.

If I travel in 5 centimeters per second for ten year,
In math, I will get `5cm x (10 x 365 + 2~3) x 24 x 24 x 60`.
But in life, I will see much scenery during the journey.
Does cherry really falls at speed of 5 centimeters per second?

English Lyric:

 > Tell me how much more do I have to lose
Before I can ever forgive myself
Do you know how much more pain I must endure
Before I can ever see your face again
One more time - Tell me why the seasons keep on changing
One more time - Missing all the times that we shared as one

 > All those times when we used to argue back and forth
I always just let you have it your way
What kind of spell did you cast on me
I even loved all of your selfish ways
One more chance - When I find myself lost in those memories
One more chance - I don't know where to go or where to land

 > It doesn't matter where I am because
I can't help but look for you everywhere
On the station platform, in the alley windows
I keep fooling myself thinking I might find you there
Never thought I would wish upon a star
I just want to be there by your side
There's nothing that I won't do, I'd give up everything
Just to hold you in my arms, one more time

 > If all I wanted was just not to be alone,
I should be happy with just anyone
But tonight the stars are hanging by a thread,
and I can't lie to myself anymore
One more time - Tell me why the seasons keep on changing
One more time - Missing all the times that we shared as one

 > It doesn't matter where I am because
Can't help but look for you everywhere
At the intersection, even in my dreams
Knowing there is no way you would be there
If I could just believe in miracles
I would do anything to show you now
In the morning light, completely new me
I'd tell you what I couldn't say before,“I love you.”

 > Memories of our summers together ooh
Our beating hearts were heard no more

 > It doesn't matter where I am because
Can't help but look for you everywhere
The morning sun rises, city of Sakuragi
I keep fooling myself thinking I might find you there
Never thought I would wish upon a star
I just need you right here by my side
There's nothing that I won't do, I'd give up everything
Just to hold you in my arms, one more time

 > It doesn't matter where I am because
Can't help but look for a trace of you
At every corner store, in the newspaper
Knowing there is no way that you would be there
If I could just believe in miracles, I would open my heart up once again
In the morning light, a completely new me
I'd tell you what I couldn't say before,“I love you.”

 > It doesn't matter where I am because
Can't help but to search for your smile
At the railway crossing, watching the trains pass by
Even though there's no way that you'd be there
If I could live my life all over again, I would be with you for all time
There's nothing else in this world I want more than what I had
There would never be anything but you that I would ask for
