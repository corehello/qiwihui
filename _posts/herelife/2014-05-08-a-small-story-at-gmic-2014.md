I attended GMIC 2014 in Beijing at May 5<sup>th</sup> and May 6<sup>th</sup>.
GMIC is short for Global Mobile Internet Conference, and it is a really huge conference. 
I just want to share a small story I heard in the conference.

In WeTalk Stage, one of the 8 stages, Zhang Fan, who is the brain behind 
[Midi Modern Music Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi_Music_Festival), gave us a speech: Listen to the Original Where Music is Eternal. 
In the speech, he shared us a song named "The Brightest Star in the Sky" of 2013 Shanghai Midi Festival
(watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7qgMJCmAHs)), and told us a story about the boy 
who was singing with tears at 2:31 in the video. The boy met his girlfriend when they are student in college, 
but they got separated after graduation and went back to their own hometown. It was the first time they saw each other
after 2 years. When catching this song, the boy couldn't stop crying with mixed feeling.
	
This is what music means that something in your deep heart and express your real feeling, I think.

I would like to go to Midi festival the next time in Beijing, and listen to this song.
